            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Uncover the dough and spread the pizza sauce on top of the pizza dough, smoothing it out until it reaches the edges. This pizza doesn't really have a crust exterior so be sure to take it to the edges too.</li>

            <li>Top it with cubed provolone (if using) and sprinkle with mozzarella. I like to add some cubes of the aged provolone close to the edge of the pan so it gets all crispy.</li>

            <li>Add the pepperoni cups on top and be sure to place them overlapping and very close together. It should look like a blanket of pepperoni.</li>

            <li>Transfer to the oven and bake for 7 minutes, rotate the pan 180 degrees. And then bake for an additional 7 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the cheese is all melty and bubbling.</li>

            <li>Allow to cool for about 5 minutes and then transfer to a large cutting board. Slice it up with a sharp knife and serve!</li>
