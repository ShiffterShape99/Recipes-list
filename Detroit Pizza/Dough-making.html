    <h1>How to make Pizza Dough</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 1:Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a 9x13-inch baking pan. The darker the aluminum, the better. This will give you a better crust.</h3>
        <h3>Step 2:In a bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, salt and instant yeast.</h3>

        <h3>Step 3:Pour in the warm water and 1 tablespoon of olive oil and mix again. The dough will be pretty wet and that's ok!</h3>

        <h3>Step 4:This is a different type of pizza dough; it will be kinda wet so don't sweat that too much. Just knead it up or mix it up until it becomes cohesive.</h3>

        <h3>Step 5:Dip your fingers into the olive oil from the pan and transfer the dough to the greased baking pan. Dimple the dough using your fingers. We're going to do this every 15 minutes until it reaches the edges. We have to stretch the dough slowly to ensure zero ripping of the dough. Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and allow it to rise in a draft-free place in your kitchen/house and set a timer for 15 minutes.</h3>

        <h3>Step 6:Return to the dough and remove the plastic wrap/towel and dimple the dough once more, spreading it close to the edges of the pan-it should be about halfway to the edges by now. Cover once more and set another timer for 15 minutes.</h3>

        <h3>Step 7:Return to the dough and dimple and stretch the dough, using extra olive oil on your hands as needed, until it reaches the edges and corners of the pan. Cover the pan and set a timer for 1 hour. This is the last rise required!</h3>
