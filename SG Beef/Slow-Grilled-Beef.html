        <h2>What Kind of Beefs to Use + Tips</h2>
        <p>There are two cuts of beef ribs: back ribs and short ribs. For this recipe, you want to use back ribs, as short ribs (with the bone) benefit from a different cooking method, such as braising. As a bonus, back ribs are also less expensive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef back ribs are what's left after the butcher removes a ribeye roast or steaks from the bones, so there is some meat in between the ribs, but not a lot. Plan on about 1 1/2 pounds per person (adult).</li>
            <li>If your beef back ribs are still connected, <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/remove-membrane-from-pork-ribs-995303">you should remove the membrane from the underside of the rack.</a> Start a corner with a knife and use a paper towel to grip the loose corner. The membrane should peel off easily.</li>
            <li>If you don't see beef ribs in the meat section of your supermarket, ask the butcher, who may have a rack of frozen or fresh beef ribs that can be cut up.</li>
            <li>When grilling, use a drip pan under the grill grates to prevent flare-ups because beef ribs have a lot of fat that will burn quickly. Keep an eye on the ribs and move them around the grill if flare-ups occur.</li>
            <li>When marinating, a large zip-top plastic bag is a great alternative to a baking dish. Just be sure to place the bag on a rimmed baking sheet or in a bowl in case the bag leaks. Move the ribs around in the bag every hour or so to make sure all of them get some time in the marinade.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Place the 4 pounds beef back ribs in a shallow, non-metal baking dish and pour the marinade over them. Make sure the ribs are evenly coated.</li>
            <img src="../pictures/SG Beef Pictures/Step3.jpg" alt="placed in marinade" width="300" height="200">

            <img src="../pictures/SG Beef Pictures/Step4.jpg" alt="about to be placed in a fridge" width="300" height="200">
            <li>Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for indirect heat. Adjust the heat on the active burner to 250 F. When the grill is hot, remove the ribs from marinade and place on the cool side of the grill to cook indirectly. Discard the marinade. Close the lid and cook until the ribs are tender, turning every 15 minutes, about 3 hours depending on meatiness of the ribs.</li>

            <li>You can apply barbecue sauce during the last 15 minutes of cook time if you like. Make sure to keep a close eye on the ribs so they don't burn.</li>
